# AI-Powered Food Recipe and Dish Generation

This project combines **Object Detection (YOLOv3)**, **Natural Language Processing (LaMini-GPT)**, and **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to automatically:

1. Detect food ingredients from an input image  
2. Generate a complete recipe using those ingredients  
3. Generate a realistic dish image using a trained GAN

## Project Motivation

Modern kitchens are full of ingredients, but home cooks often lack ideas on what to cook. This project solves that by turning an image of ingredients or a dish into:

- A **detailed recipe** (using NLP)  
- A **realistic food image** (using a GAN)  

This automation helps:
-  Home cooks looking for quick suggestions  
-  Food bloggers/chefs generating content  
-  Recipe apps improving UX with visual suggestions

##  Project Components

### 1. Ingredient Detection (Object Detection)
- **Model Used**: YOLOv3  
- **Dataset**: COCO (pre-trained)  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV  
- **Output**: List of food-related ingredients detected from the input image  

### 2. Recipe Generation (Natural Language Processing)
- **Model Used**: `MBZUAI/LaMini-GPT-774M`  
- **Library**: HuggingFace Transformers  
- **Input**: Detected ingredients  
- **Output**: Recipe with:  
  - Title  
  - Preparation & Cooking Time  
  - Ingredient Quantities  
  - Instructions  
  - Serving Suggestion & Nutrition Tip  

### 3. Dish Image Generation (Generative Adversarial Network)
- **Model Type**: DCGAN  
- **Dataset**: Food-101  
- **Framework**: PyTorch  
- **Input**: Random noise vector  
- **Output**: Synthetic dish image
